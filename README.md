# KiddoLang

**KiddoLang** is a beginner-friendly programming language designed to introduce children to the fundamentals of programming in a fun, simple, and easy-to-understand way. The goal of the language is to make coding approachable for young learners, with a syntax that is intuitive and readable.


## Project Goals
- Create a language with minimal and friendly syntax suitable for children.
- Ensure readability and clear logical flow in code.
- Support basic operations, conditionals, and loops in an intuitive manner.
- Make learning programming fun through an educational-first design.


## Tools and Technologies

We will be using ANTLR as the Lexical analyzer, Parser and since ANTLR supports mutiple languages we will be using Java/Python as our Interpreter(will be decided in the future).

## Target Platforms

KiddoLang is being developed to support the following systems:
- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

## Planned Language Features
- Primitives: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`
- Arithmetic: `+ - * /`
- Logic: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Conditionals: `if`, `? :`
- Loops: `for`, `while`
- `print()` statement
